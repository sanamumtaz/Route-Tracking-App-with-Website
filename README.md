# Route-Tracking-App-with-Website
Android and Web development - Google APIs

This was my internship project. First experience with Google APIs.

Purpose of the application is to assign a travelling route to a user (employee) while bounding the user to travel within the described route. There are two sides of this project: Web and Android. There is an admin on web side who assigns routes, and there are users on Android side who have to follow the assigned route.
## Requirements:
**Admin - Web**: - Search locations, select starting and ending of journey
- Select a route among multiple routes suggested
- Monitor the travel progress of user
- Be notified when user diverts from the assigned route
**User - Android**: - User can view the assigned route using the route Id (already known to user)
- Start travelling on route, and upon reaching destination stop
- Be notified whenever user diverts from the path
## Implementation

### Server side:
All PHP
### User - Android app:
